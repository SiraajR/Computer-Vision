# Real-Time Object Detection and Recognition System

 ## Overview
This computer vision project aims to develop a real-time object detection and recognition system using deep learning techniques. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and pre-trained models such as InceptionV3, the system can accurately detect and recognize objects captured in a live camera feed. The project incorporates OpenCV for image processing and interfacing with the camera, providing a seamless and efficient solution for object detection tasks.

## Key Features
Real-Time Object Detection: The system can detect objects in real-time as they appear in the camera feed, enabling immediate analysis and response.
Object Recognition: By utilizing pre-trained deep learning models, the system accurately recognizes objects with high precision, providing valuable insights into the environment.
Flexible Configuration: The project offers flexibility in choosing and integrating different pre-trained models and neural network architectures, allowing customization based on specific requirements and use cases.
User-Friendly Interface: The interface provides a user-friendly experience, displaying detected objects and their labels in real-time, making it intuitive for users to interpret the results.
Application Versatility: This project finds applications across various domains such as surveillance, autonomous systems, robotics, and augmented reality, showcasing its versatility and potential impact in diverse fields.

## Accuracy

The model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test dataset. However, it's important to note that the model's performance may vary based on the size and diversity of the dataset and the complexity of the images. 

Due to resource constraints and limited label availability, the scope of the model is relatively small. For example, it can accurately detect common objects such as my coffee mug,
