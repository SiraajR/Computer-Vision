# Real-Time Object Detection and Recognition System

 ## Overview
This computer vision project aims to develop a real-time object detection and recognition system using deep learning techniques. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and pre-trained models such as InceptionV3, the system can accurately detect and recognize objects captured in a live camera feed. The project incorporates OpenCV for image processing and interfacing with the camera, providing a seamless and efficient solution for object detection tasks.

## Key Features
Real-Time Object Detection: The system can detect objects in real-time as they appear in the camera feed, enabling immediate analysis and response.
Object Recognition: By utilizing pre-trained deep learning models, the system accurately recognizes objects with high precision, providing valuable insights into the environment.
Flexible Configuration: The project offers flexibility in choosing and integrating different pre-trained models and neural network architectures, allowing customization based on specific requirements and use cases.
User-Friendly Interface: The interface provides a user-friendly experience, displaying detected objects and their labels in real-time, making it intuitive for users to interpret the results.
Application Versatility: This project finds applications across various domains such as surveillance, autonomous systems, robotics, and augmented reality, showcasing its versatility and potential impact in diverse fields.
